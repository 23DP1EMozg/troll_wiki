            </div>
            <div id="text">
                <p>Cats (Felis catus) are small, carnivorous mammals that have been domesticated for thousands of years. They are one of the most popular pets worldwide due to their independent yet affectionate nature. Cats belong to the Felidae family, which includes wild relatives such as lions, tigers, and cheetahs.</p>
                <br/>
                <p><span class="bold">Size:</span> Most domestic cats weigh between 3 to 7 kg (6.6 to 15.4 lbs) and measure about 23 to 25 cm (9 to 10 inches) tall at the shoulder.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Lifespan:</span> The average lifespan of a domestic cat is around 12–18 years, with some reaching 20+ years.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Vision:</span> Cats have excellent night vision, allowing them to see in light levels six times lower than humans.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Whiskers:</span> Their whiskers, or vibrissae, are highly sensitive and help them navigate in the dark and detect movement.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Purring:</span> Cats purr when they are content, but they may also purr when in pain or stressed as a self-soothing mechanism.</p>

            <h2>History and Domestication</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Cats were domesticated around 9,000 years ago in the Near East. They were likely drawn to human settlements because of the abundance of rodents in grain storage areas. In ancient Egypt, cats were revered and even worshiped, with many Egyptian gods depicted as feline-like figures.</p>
        <p>Throughout history, cats have played various roles in human society, from pest control to companionship. During the Middle Ages, they were associated with witchcraft in some cultures, leading to mass killings that contributed to the spread of the Black Plague (due to an increase in rat populations). Today, they are cherished pets in millions of households.</p>
